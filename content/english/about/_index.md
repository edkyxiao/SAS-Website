  SAS Percussion Studio, founded in 2018 is one of the Melbourne's premier percussion studios, dedicated to developing high-level Chinese traditional percussion ensembles and Western percussion groups.<br><br>

  Students of SAS Studio Percussion perform as percussionists in many of Melbourne's top schools and youth symphony orchestras.

  Our curriculum covers essential percussion techniques (snare drum, drum kit, etc.), traditional Chinese percussion (such as Tanggu, flowerpot drums, and the five-tone drum set), and Western percussion (including marimba and timpani). We support a wide range of examination systems, including Rock School, AMEB Percussion, VCE, and university-level percussion exams in Melbourne. The studio is fully equipped with advanced percussion instruments and a professional stage setup featuring lighting, sound, and multimedia systems.

      Chinese Percussion from the Shenyang Conservatory of Music. Based in Melbourne, Australia, it is one of the region's premier percussion studios, dedicated to developing high-level Chinese traditional percussion ensembles and Western percussion groups.<br><br>

      Students of SAS Studio Percussion perform as percussionists in many of Melbourne's top schools and youth symphony orchestras. Over the years, SAS has held numerous large-scale concerts featuring both traditional Chinese and Western percussion, as well as intensive student-teacher performances and showcases.<br><br>

      Our curriculum covers essential percussion techniques (snare drum, drum kit, etc.), traditional Chinese percussion (such as Tanggu, flowerpot drums, and the five-tone drum set), and Western percussion (including marimba and timpani). We support a wide range of examination systems, including Rock School, AMEB Percussion, VCE, and university-level percussion exams in Melbourne. The studio is fully equipped with advanced percussion instruments and a professional stage setup featuring lighting, sound, and multimedia systems.
